          Zelda has 9 friends A1,...,A9.
          Zelda wants the following to happen:
          IF 4 or more of A1,...,A9 they can determine what s is.
          IF 3 or less of A1,...,A9 get together they can determine NOTHING.
          (They can't even determine the first bit of s, they can't even know that
          the first bit is MORE LIKELY to be a 0, really NOTHING!)
          Zelda will do this by giving each of A1,...,A9 a string or set of strings.
          Can Zelda do this?
          If so then how long will the strings be?

          Machine Learning. In particular, he is fascinated by the diversity of human languages in the world, and enjoys
          designing algorithms that teach computers how to understand and translate language. <br><br> In my talk, I
          will describe the exciting field of Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics. This is a
          research area that may appeal to both STEM and humanities students alike. Human language is an innately
          complex yet structured “object” that can be studied under the lens of computer science. Additionally, human
          language is simultaneously both diverse (i.e. 6000+ languages in the world) and universal (i.e. there are
          common properties that exist for all languages). I will give a quick tour of this interdisciplinary field and
          focus on some example applications like Google Translate. </p>
